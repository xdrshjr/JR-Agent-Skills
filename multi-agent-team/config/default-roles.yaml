# Default Role Definitions for Multi-Agent Team
#
# This file serves as REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION for role definitions.
# The system uses dynamic role generation at runtime (see council-workflow.js).
#
# Design Principles:
# - Generic skill categories (not specific skill names)
# - Task-agnostic roles (defined by capabilities)
# - Environment-independent (no hardcoded paths)
# - Collaboration-aware (defines inputs/outputs)
# - Extensible (easy to add custom roles)

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# This file is REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION. The system uses dynamic role generation
# at runtime (see pm-workflow.js:332-395).
#
# How to use this file:
# 1. PM can reference role definitions when assembling teams
# 2. Agents can match skill_categories against discovered skills
# 3. Team templates provide starting points for common task types
# 4. Collaboration interfaces help define agent interactions
#
# Design principles:
# - Generic: No hardcoded skill names or paths
# - Extensible: Easy to add custom roles
# - Collaboration-aware: Defines clear interfaces
# - Task-agnostic: Works for any task type
# - Environment-independent: Works on any computer
#
# Future enhancement:
# - Optional runtime loader (src/role-loader.ts)
# - Can enhance or replace dynamic generation
# - Backward compatible with existing system
