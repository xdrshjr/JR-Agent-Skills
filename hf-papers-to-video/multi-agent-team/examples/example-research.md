## Execution (SUPERVISED)

### Milestone 1: Understanding Confirmation [T+0]
PM: "I'll research AI agent frameworks and create a comparison report covering AutoGPT, LangChain Agents, and similar tools. The report will include capabilities, limitations, use cases, and recommendations."

User: ✅ "Yes, also include BabyAGI and mention emerging frameworks."

### Kickoff [T+2]
PM spawns team with updated scope.

### Milestone 2: Plan Confirmation [T+5]
PM: "Research Analyst has identified 6 major frameworks. Technical Writer proposes structure: Executive Summary → Framework Profiles → Comparison Matrix → Use Case Recommendations → Future Outlook. Editor confirms scope is manageable. Proceed?"

User: ✅ "Add a 'Getting Started' section for beginners."

PM updates plan accordingly.

### Progress [T+12]
- Research: Compiled data on 6 frameworks (AutoGPT, LangChain, BabyAGI, SuperAGI, MetaGPT, AutoGen)
- Writer: Drafted Executive Summary and 3 framework profiles
- Editor: Reviewed structure, suggested adding comparison criteria upfront

Collaboration:
Writer → Research: "Need specific version numbers and release dates"
Research → Writer: "Added to data sheet"

### Milestone 3: Draft Review [T+18]
PM: "Draft report complete (~3000 words). Structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Framework Overview (6 tools)
3. Comparison Matrix
4. Use Case Guide
5. Getting Started Recommendations
6. Future Outlook

Please review: [draft-report.md]"

User: ✅ "Looks good. Expand the limitations section and add pricing info if available."

### Revision [T+22]
Writer expands limitations. Research finds pricing data. Editor polishes.

### Milestone 4: Final Acceptance [T+25]
PM: "Final report ready:
- 3500 words
- 6 frameworks covered
- Comparison matrix with 12 criteria
- Updated limitations and pricing
- Professional formatting

Accept and deliver?"

User: ✅ "Yes, looks great!"
