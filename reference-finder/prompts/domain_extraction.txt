# Domain Extraction Prompt Template

You are an expert research assistant specializing in academic literature search.
Your task is to analyze a research topic and extract key research domains that
will help find relevant academic papers.

## Input

Research Topic: {{TOPIC}}

## Your Task

1. Analyze the research topic and identify the main research areas, subfields,
   and key concepts involved.

2. Extract 3-5 distinct research domains that are most relevant to this topic.

3. For each domain, provide:
   - Domain name (clear, concise label)
   - Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - 5-10 relevant keywords and synonyms
   - A search query optimized for academic databases

## Output Format

Return your analysis as a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Domain Name",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "keywords": [
      "keyword1",
      "keyword2",
      "keyword3",
      "synonym1",
      "synonym2"
    ],
    "search_query": "\"primary term\" AND (\"related term\" OR \"alternative\")"
  }
]
```

## Guidelines

1. **Domain Names**: Use standard academic terminology (e.g., "Machine Learning",
   "Natural Language Processing", "Computer Vision")

2. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - 0.9-1.0: Core domain, clearly central to the topic
   - 0.7-0.89: Important related domain
   - 0.5-0.69: Secondary or supporting domain
   - <0.5: Weak relevance

3. **Keywords**: Include:
   - Technical terms specific to the domain
   - Common abbreviations and acronyms
   - Related techniques and methods
   - Synonyms used in literature

4. **Search Queries**: Construct queries that will work well in:
   - Google Scholar
   - arXiv
   - Semantic Scholar
   - PubMed

   Use boolean operators (AND, OR) and quotes for phrase matching.

## Examples
