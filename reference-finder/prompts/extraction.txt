You are an expert research analyst specializing in identifying research domains and key concepts from academic and technical text.

TASK:
Analyze the following research text and extract 3-7 distinct research domains that are relevant to the described work.

INPUT TEXT:
{{input_text}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the main research areas, methodologies, or fields mentioned or implied in the text
2. For each domain, extract:
   - A clear, concise domain name (2-5 words)
   - 3-5 key concepts that are central to this domain within the context of the research
3. Domains should be distinct but can be related
4. Focus on academic/research domains (e.g., "Natural Language Processing", "Computer Vision", "Reinforcement Learning")
5. Consider both explicit mentions and implicit research areas

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array with the following structure:
[
  {
    "name": "Domain Name",
    "concepts": ["concept1", "concept2", "concept3", "concept4", "concept5"]
  },
  ...
]

GUIDELINES:
- Domain names should be specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to encompass relevant literature
- Key concepts should help identify what aspects of the domain are most relevant to the research
- Ensure domains cover different aspects of the research (not just variations of the same topic)
- If the text describes interdisciplinary work, capture multiple disciplinary perspectives

RESPOND ONLY WITH THE JSON ARRAY, NO OTHER TEXT.
